# 12-Week LeetCode Study Plan

I am following the **12-week LeetCode study plan** outlined by Dave Burji to enhance my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews. 

## Study Plan Overview

The plan is well-structured and spread over 12 weeks, targeting different topics essential for coding interviews. Each week focuses on specific types of problems, gradually increasing in complexity.

## Resources

- **Video Guide**: [Dave Burji's LeetCode Study Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKP-Vca9Q4c&t) provides a comprehensive overview and tips for effectively tackling the problems week by week.

- **Notion Doc**: The [original study plan](https://ubiquitous-dragonfly-2fd.notion.site/12-Week-Leetcode-Preparation-Guide-e8e0b24383f54b0fb52832ef99b42c34) on Notion outlines the weekly topics and includes additional resources and problem sets.

- **My Notion Doc**: I have also created a [personalized study guide](https://jasper-jonquil-692.notion.site/12-Week-Leetcode-Preparation-Guide-ae1d34143b1d49aa981e0901d86d7f6a?pvs=4) that adapts the original plan to my progress and reflections and including tests.
